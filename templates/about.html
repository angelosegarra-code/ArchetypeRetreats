    <h1>About Archetype Retreats</h1>
    <p><strong>Archetype Retreats</strong> is a space to slow down, listen inward, and reconnect with the rhythm of your creative life.</p>

    <h2>What is an archetype?</h2>
    <p>Archetypes are recurring patterns in how we think, feel, and respond. They reflect deep symbolic energies that shape our choices and stories.</p>

    <h2>How we support growth</h2>
    <p>We help you trace the thread of your inner story—discovering where your journey began and how it continues to unfold. As you reconnect with intuition and creative practice, the mind becomes a tool, not the destination—bringing heart and mind into alignment.</p>

    <h2>Join us</h2>
    <p>Quiet, art-filled days in Bali. Gentle structure. Real transformation. <a href="{{ url_for('retreats') }}">Explore retreats →</a></p>
