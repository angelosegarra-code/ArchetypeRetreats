    <h1>About Archetype Retreats</h1>
    <p><strong>Archetype Retreats</strong> is a place to slow down, listen inward, and reconnect with the rhythm of your creative self.</p>

    <h2>What is an archetype?</h2>
    <p>Archetypes are <strong>recurring patterns</strong> in how we think, feel, and respond. They reflect deep symbolic energies that shape how we see the world.</p>

    <h2>How Archetype Retreats supports growth</h2>
    <p>We help you trace the thread of your inner story — discovering where your journey began and how it continues to unfold. Through guided reflection, art, and connection, you move closer to the balance between heart and mind — understanding the mind as a tool, not the end itself.</p>

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <p>Quiet, art-filled days in Bali. Gentle structure. Real transformation. <a href="{{ url_for('retreats') }}">Explore upcoming retreats →</a></p>
