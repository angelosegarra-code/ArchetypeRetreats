      <h2>What This Book Is</h2>

      <p>
        Most approaches to change focus on fixing problems or improving performance.
        <em>The Alchemy of Change</em> looks beneath those efforts, toward the patterns
        that quietly organize behavior in individuals and systems alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a method, framework, or set of instructions.
        It is an exploration of how transformation occurs when awareness enters the field —
        allowing systems to reorganize themselves without force, blame, or collapse.

  <!-- WHY ARCHETYPES -->
  <section class="book-section soft-bg">
    <div class="wrap narrow">
      <h2>Why Archetypes Matter</h2>

      <p>
        Archetypes are not personality labels.
        They are recurring patterns of movement within a system.
      </p>

      <p>
        When one person shifts how they perceive, respond, or hold attention,
        the system does not simply improve — it compensates, resists, or reorganizes.
        This is why surface change so often fails, and why deeper change cannot be imposed.
      </p>

      <p>
        By understanding archetypal dynamics, readers begin to see how individual insight
        and systemic transformation are inseparable.

      <h2>How This Book Connects to the Work</h2>

      <p>
        Some readers stop here — and that is enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Others continue through archetypal inquiry, online dialogue,
        or immersive work with groups and organizations.
        The book does not prescribe a path. It clarifies one.
