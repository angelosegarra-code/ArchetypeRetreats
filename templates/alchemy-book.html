        <h2>What This Book Is</h2>
        <p>
          <em>The Alchemy of Change</em> is a short, foundational work on second-order change:
          the kind of transformation that happens when a system becomes aware of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It explores the narrative field — how meaning forms, how patterns persist,
          and why awareness changes what problem-solving cannot.

        The work begins not with knowing what to do,
        but with being aware of what is already happening —
        in the psyche, in the room, and in the system.

      <div class="excerpt">
        <p><strong>From “The Narrative Field”</strong></p>
        <p>
          This is the art beneath all facilitation — the alchemy beneath all transformation.
          It begins not with knowing what to do, but with being aware of what is already happening.
          And when awareness enters the field, the story finds its next movement on its own.

      <h2>Second-Order Change for Organizations</h2>
      <p>
        Alchemy, as described in this work, is second-order change.
        Paradoxically, it is not a method for improving systems.
        It is a way of holding attention that allows systems to reorganize their own patterns
        without collapsing into blame or defensiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the moment when the system begins to be aware that it is a system.
