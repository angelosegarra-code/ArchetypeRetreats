<section class="section">

    <h2>From Improvement to Awareness</h2>

    <p>Most approaches to change begin with a problem to solve. This work begins somewhere else.</p>

    <p>
      First-order change focuses on improving what already exists.
      Second-order change alters the conditions that shape behavior, culture, and meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The Alchemy of Change</em> introduces this distinction and how it unfolds
      personally, relationally, and collectively.

      <h2>One Way to Begin</h2>

      <p>
        Some people begin through reflection and reading.
        Others through symbolic self-recognition.

        The Archetype Explorer is a brief mirror — not a diagnosis —
        designed to reveal how attention and narrative organize experience.

<!-- WHY GROUPS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Why Retreats and Small Groups Matter</h2>

    <p>Second-order change cannot be implemented.</p>

    <p>
      It requires time, containment, and shared attention —
      conditions rarely available in everyday life or organizational structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retreats and facilitated groups create temporary fields
      where systems can recognize themselves.
      What emerges is not a plan, but a shift in perception.

      <h2>Learn to Hold the Field</h2>

      <p>
        Some people begin this work for personal clarity.
        Over time, they feel drawn to hold attention for others —
        in groups, teams, and organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Facilitation here is not technique-based.
        It is a practice of perception,
        allowing systems to reorganize without force or blame.
