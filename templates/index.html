<!-- SECTION: WHAT THIS IS -->
<section class="section section-light center">
  <h2>This Is Not Self-Improvement.</h2>
  <p>
    Most change begins with refinement. Optimize. Adjust. Try harder.
    For a time, it works.
  </p>
  <p>
    But lasting transformation does not begin with improvement.
    It begins when awareness enters the field itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Archetype Retreats are designed for that shift.

      <h3>Immersive Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Small-group retreats in Bali designed for depth, not performance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Second-Order Change</h3>
      <p>
        We work beneath behavior — at the level of structure and field.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Intimate Cohorts</h3>
      <p>
        Private, high-attention environments with limited participants.

<!-- SECTION: THE SETTING -->
<section class="section section-image">
  <div class="image-content">
    <h2>The Setting Matters.</h2>
    <p>
      Transformation does not occur in noise.
      Our retreats are held in carefully selected environments in Bali —
      spaces that invite stillness, depth, and sustained reflection.
