<!-- FROM IMPROVEMENT TO AWARENESS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>When Improvement Becomes Inspiration</h2>

    <p>
    Most approaches to change begin with improvement.
    Something isn’t working, so we refine it, optimize it, or try harder.
    </p>

    <p>
    And for a time, this helps.
    </p>

    <p>
    But improvement works within existing conditions.
    When those conditions are misaligned, even successful improvement can feel exhausting.
    </p>

    <p>
    Inspiration enters when attention shifts —
    not toward fixing what’s broken, but toward noticing what is already shaping experience.
    </p>

    <p><em>
    The Alchemy of Change explores this shift, and how it unfolds personally, relationally, and collectively.
    </em></p>
    
    <p>
      First-order change focuses on improving what already exists.
      Second-order change alters the conditions that shape behavior, culture, and meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The Alchemy of Change</em> introduces this distinction and how it unfolds
      personally, relationally, and collectively.

     <h3>A Simple Way to Begin</h3>

      <p>
      Some people begin through quiet reflection.
      Others through symbolic self-recognition.
      </p>

      <p>
      There is no right starting point — only what feels natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Archetype Explorer is a brief mirror — not a diagnosis —
        designed to reveal how attention and narrative organize experience.

<!-- WHY GROUPS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Why Retreats and Small Groups Matter</h2>

    <p>Second-order change cannot be implemented.</p>

    <p>
      It requires time, containment, and shared attention —
      conditions rarely available in everyday life or organizational structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retreats and facilitated groups create temporary fields
      where systems can recognize themselves.
      What emerges is not a plan, but a shift in perception.

      <p>
        Some people begin this work for personal clarity.
        Over time, they feel drawn to hold attention for others —
        in groups, teams, and organizations.

      <p>
        Facilitation here is not technique-based.
        It is a practice of perception,
