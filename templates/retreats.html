  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section class="section retreat-intro">
    <p>
      Archetype Immersions are held in Bali and designed for recalibration, clarity,
      and integration. Participants may arrive individually, as intact teams, or
      as part of an organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are not retreats in the conventional sense. They are carefully
      facilitated environments where systems learn how to listen to themselves —
      to their people, their patterns, and the forces shaping them.
