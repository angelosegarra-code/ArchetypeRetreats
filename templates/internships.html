    <h1 class="page-title">Internships & Arts Immersions</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Long-form creative immersion programs across Indonesia.
    </p>

    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        This is not a short retreat.  
        It is not a course.  
        And it is not a tour.
      </p>
      <p>
        These internships are long-form immersions for students and emerging creatives
        who want to live inside artistic and cultural practice—not observe it from a distance.
      </p>
